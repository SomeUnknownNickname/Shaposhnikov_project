            <p>Gaming programmers use programming languages, such as Adobe ActionScript, C++ and Java, to create graphics, sound, artificial intelligence and tools in video games. To create artificial intelligence, you could write code to make computer-controlled characters more realistic in terms of expression, reaction and communication. If you'd rather work in graphics or sound programming, you could work to perfect the playback of music, audio effects or animation. As a tool programmer, you'd create a set of digital directives within the gaming software that allows designers to add their art, music, sound effects and game play information directly into the game. Depending on your job and the game you're creating, you could be responsible for programming one aspect of a game or the whole game. The work of programming and coding involves abstract concepts and mathematical formulas. Each piece of code must be written to exact specifications. This means as a programmer, you must pay attention to detail and be patient enough to work through each line of often repetitious code. Additionally, you must be able to think analytically to solve problems with graphics, game play or integration.</p>
