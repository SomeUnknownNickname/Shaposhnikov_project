              <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>It's pretty personal thing - depends on you and area you plan to work with. If you choose front-end development in web you wouldn't need that much time to start working that you will spend on learning how to make high quality programs on C++ </p>

              <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>The same as in previous answer, it's very personal. But usually it takes more than half a year even for the easiest areas (if you start from 0).</p>

              <div class="accordion-header">How to choose what the area is the best to start with?</div>
              <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>Nowadays all programs, companies and even some games have it's web version, so web development is one of the most in-demand areas. At the same time, you can start way easier than in other areas, becouse there's no need in deep knowledge of math, phisics, languages etc.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>As more as possible. As faster you want to stay at least junior developer as more time you need to spend. But if we talk about minimal time, I'd say that if you study programming even less than 1-2 hours a day it won't be effective at all </p>
