            <p>Database programming involves designing and maintaining a database for an application. Best practices include establishing relationships between different data sets and testing for errors and duplicate records. Retrieving instances of data from the database is another key responsibility in database programming.  The maintenance and management functions are handled by a database administrator who ensures that the database in the system is always available.  Databases serve an important function for many individuals and companies, providing a practical way to organize and store information on a computer. In programming, developers use database programming languages to maintain and monitor an electronic database and its management system.  These languages perform a variety of critical tasks that help a database management system function correctly. Let’s have a look at the role of database programming and the languages that programmers use in database programming. Database languages, commonly referred to as query languages, are a type of programming language that programmers use to define and access data. As we are moving toward a more tech-driven world database programming languages is one of the most demanding skills in the employment arena one should be familiar. </p>
